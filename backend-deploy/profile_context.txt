CHATBOT & GENERATIVE AI SHOWCASE
==================================================

This chatbot was built by Ayushya Shrivastav as a Generative AI portfolio project.

Purpose:
- To allow recruiters to query professional experience, projects, and skills conversationally.
- To demonstrate applied Generative AI and system design skills.

Technologies Used:
- Backend: FastAPI
- LLM Provider: Groq (LLaMA 3.1)
- Prompt Engineering: Context-injected system prompts
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Deployment: Render (Free Tier)

Architecture Design:
- A complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FAISS and embeddings was implemented locally.
- Due to memory constraints on free-tier cloud infrastructure, the deployed version uses a prompt-engineered, context-based approach instead of vector search.
- This design ensures reliability, low latency, and zero infrastructure cost while maintaining answer accuracy.

Generative AI Skills Demonstrated:
- Prompt engineering and system instruction design
- Trade-off analysis between RAG-based and lightweight architectures
- Safe handling of sensitive information
- API-based LLM integration
- Real-world deployment constraints and optimization
